Objective: Design and develop a micro-milling machine tool using epoxy granite for improved thermal stability and damping characteristics, eliminating steel reinforcements.

Approach: Initially, prototype a cast iron structure to understand assembly challenges and operational requirements. Redesign using epoxy granite guidelines to enhance feasibility.

Design Evolution: Transition from EG Design-1, which proved impractical for manufacturing due to complex geometry, to EG Design-2, incorporating feasible manufacturing principles.

Analysis: Conduct finite element analysis (FEA) to assess static and dynamic behaviors. Modal analysis confirms stable natural frequencies, with maximum deformation of 32.05 microns under worst-case cutting conditions.

Outcome: Successfully validate EG Design-2 for stability in both idle and operational states. Redesigned base for ease of molding, emphasizing manufacturability and assembly efficiency.
